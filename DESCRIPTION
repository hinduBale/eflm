Description: Efficient Fitting of Generalized Linear Models by using just base 
  R. As an alternative to "glm", this package provides "fglm" (fast glm), with a 
  significant speedup when the number of observations is larger than the number 
  of parameters to estimate, as it reduces the NxP model matrix to a PxP matrix. 
  The best computational performance is obtained when R is linked against 
  OpenBLAS, Intel MKL or other optimized BLAS library. This implementation aims 
  at being compatible with broom, sandwich and other packages for summary 
  statistics and clustering by providing S3 methods.
