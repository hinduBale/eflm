Description: Efficient Fitting of Linear and Generalized Linear Models by using
  just base R. As an alternative to lm() and glm(), this package provides elm()
  and eglm(), with a significant speedup when the number of 
  observations is larger than the number of parameters to estimate, as it 
  reduces the NxP model matrix to a PxP matrix. The best computational 
  performance is obtained when R is linked against OpenBLAS, Intel MKL or other
  optimized BLAS library. This implementation aims at being compatible with 
  'broom' and 'sandwich' packages for summary statistics and clustering by 
  providing S3 methods.
